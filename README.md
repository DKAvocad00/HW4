# Customer Analysis, Segmentation & Prediction

Welcome to the Customer Analysis, Segmentation & Prediction project repository! In this project, we dive into customer segmentation, a detailed analysis of ideal customers for a company. Understanding customer needs, behaviors, and problems across different segments is crucial for tailoring products and services effectively.

Customer segmentation allows businesses to modify their products based on the specific needs of different customer types. For example, instead of opening new physical stores, a company might enhance its online shopping experience for customers who prefer internet purchases.

In this work, we explore the dataset [marketing_campaign.csv](link-to-dataset) (also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/marketing-campaign)).

## Notebook Usage

1. Ensure that you read the dataset from the correct directory.
2. The notebook requires the following libraries:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - plotly
   - sklearn
   - yellowbrick
     
Make sure they are installed in your runtime environment.

## Project Highlights

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Statistical summaries and data visualization techniques.
  
2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Feature creation and modification, removal of less useful features.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Separability analysis using t-SNE, dimensionality reduction using PCA.

4. **Customer Clustering:**
   - KMeans clustering, determination of optimal cluster count, and model training using RandomForest.

## Project Outcome

After the project completion, we identified four distinct customer clusters characterized by:
   - Income levels
   - Purchase amounts per visit
   - Family size
   - Preference for online or offline purchases
   - Purchase frequency

## Key Insights

The analysis revealed that the highest revenue comes from customers who prefer in-store purchases. Thus, focusing efforts on improving relations with this cluster is recommended. Enhancing the attractiveness of physical stores, ensuring convenience, and optimizing payment processes could be pivotal for growth.
